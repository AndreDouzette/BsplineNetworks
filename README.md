# BsplineNetworks

The code for performing the experiments discussed in my masters thesis in applied mathematics.

The code is written in Python using Tensorflow, and implements spline activation functions in neural networks. The spline activation functions are implemented as B-splines with fixed and free knots.

Spline activation functions for neural networks is located in [splineOp](./splineOp). The code for testign convergence to a spline function is also in this directory. ([splineFitting.py](./splineOp/splineFitting.py))
